**# CS 330 – Final Project Reflection (Module 8 Journal)**


**How do I approach designing software?**

I start by clearly defining the project’s purpose and constraints, then map out the main systems using modular design. For my 3D Scene, I separated texture handling, lighting, materials, and object meshes into their own components. I design with scalability in mind so each part can be reused or expanded later.

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**

This project strengthened my ability to combine artistic layout and technical structure—using spatial balance, texture selection, and lighting design to guide the viewer’s attention while maintaining organized, reusable code.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**

I followed an iterative design loop: prototype → test visually → refine. Each milestone focused on one system (geometry, lighting, textures), then I reviewed the render results and adjusted parameters for realism and performance.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**

Modular, iterative design will help me in both game development and software engineering projects. Breaking large systems into small visual or functional modules makes debugging easier and speeds up improvements.






**How do I approach developing programs?**

I approach development as a series of testable milestones. I set up a clean build environment, implement one subsystem at a time, verify it runs, then integrate it with others.

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**

I used shader debugging, incremental testing, and resource isolation (each texture/mesh loaded once and reused). I also used Git for version control and kept a working .exe in the repository for validation.

**How did iteration factor into your development?**

Iteration was essential—every adjustment to lighting or transformations required multiple test runs. Small, constant iterations helped me catch logic and syntax issues early instead of during final integration.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?**

I became more disciplined about structure and readability. By milestone 7, my focus shifted from “making it run” to “making it maintainable,” with consistent formatting, comments, and reusable helper functions.






**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Computer science provides the foundation for building complex, interactive systems—from apps and games to simulations. These skills directly support my long-term goals of creating professional-quality software and immersive digital experiences.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**

This course deepened my understanding of 3D math, transformations, and GPU pipelines—concepts that will transfer to advanced graphics, AI-driven visualization, and game-engine development courses.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**

Professionally, I can now create optimized scenes with realistic lighting and textures, giving me a strong base for roles in game development, simulation, or interactive design. Understanding OpenGL, shaders, and visual storytelling makes my software not only functional but visually engaging.
